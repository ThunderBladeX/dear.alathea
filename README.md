# dear.alathea

A production-ready personal art site with character sheets, commission calculator, and blog. Built with Flask, optimized for performance, and designed to scale.

## What it does

- **Gallery** - Upload art, people can comment and vote
- **Characters** - T-pose base images with clothing you can toggle on/off
- **Blog** - Write posts with previews
- **Commissions** - Calculator with your prices and modifiers
- **Comments** - Threaded discussions with country tags
- **Admin panel** - Upload stuff and manage content

## Architecture

This is a proper Flask application with:
- **Blueprint-based routing** for scalability
- **libsql-client** for Turso database compatibility
- **Environment-based configuration** perfect for Vercel
- **Optimized database queries** (no N+1 problems)
- **Flask application context** for efficient connection management
- **Service layer** for business logic separation

## Complete setup walkthrough

### Step 1: Get the files and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThunderBladeX/dear.alathea
cd dear.alathea
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Set environment variables

**For local development:**
```bash
export FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
export ADMIN_USERNAME=youradmin
export ADMIN_PASSWORD=yoursecurepassword
# Turso variables optional for local (uses SQLite fallback)
python run.py
```

**For Vercel deployment:**
Set these in your Vercel project settings:
- `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`
- `TURSO_DATABASE_URL`
- `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN` 
- `ADMIN_USERNAME`
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`

### Step 3: Deploy

The app automatically detects if you're running locally (SQLite) or in production (Turso). Just deploy to Vercel and it will use the Turso database.

    'full': 60
}
```

### Colors and styling
Same CSS variables in `static/style.css`:
```css
:root {
    --primary-cream: #FFF8E7;
    --dusty-rose: #D4A5A5;
    /* etc... */
}
```

### Social links

## Security

- Admin credentials from environment variables
- CSRF protection headers
- Input validation and sanitization
- Parameterized database queries prevent SQL injection
- IP tracking for spam prevention
- Secure file uploads with UUID naming

## Troubleshooting

**Import errors:**
Make sure all `__init__.py` files exist in app/ and subdirectories.

**Database connection errors:**
Check that libsql-client is installed and environment variables are set correctly.

**Image optimization fails:**
The app falls back to serving original images if optimization fails.

**Vercel deployment issues:**
Check that `run.py` is the entry point and all environment variables are set.
